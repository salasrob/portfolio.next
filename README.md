## Ah the README

Hello! Welcome to yet another README. I'll keep it short and sweet.

This awesome design was originally created by [Brittany Chiang](https://brittanychiang.com/). I created it from scratch and used her CSS. I took out some things I didn't need. If you use this code for your portfolio please make sure to give credit to Brittany Chiang. 

I used [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs), [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and [Tailwinds CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. To run development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Add your own awesome experience to it
- Update the Hero text and short intro in page.tsx. The rest comes from a config file that acts as a data source.
- Add your own portfolio.json config as a data source for the portfolio web app. I've included a sample schema in /Public folder.
- Add a PDF of your resume in the /Public folder

4. Add in more features :). Don't forget to give credit to Brittany Chiang!!
